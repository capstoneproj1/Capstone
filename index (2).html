                <p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that is capable of performing various operations and executing instructions to process data. It consists of hardware components, such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, monitor), and communication interfaces.<br><br>

                    At its core, a computer uses a binary system, representing information as a sequence of ones and zeros, known as binary digits or bits. It can store, manipulate, and retrieve data using these binary representations. Computers operate based on instructions provided by software, which is a collection of programs and data that enable the computer to perform specific tasks and computations.<br><br>
                    
                    Computers are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, including calculations, data processing, information storage and retrieval, communication, and multimedia presentation. They can run various types of software applications, such as operating systems, productivity software, graphics software, games, and web browsers.<br><br>
                    
                    Modern computers come in different forms, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and embedded systems. They are used in numerous fields and industries, such as business, education, research, entertainment, healthcare, and scientific exploration. Computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, access information, and solve complex problems in our daily lives.</p>

                            <p>A computer case, also known as a computer chassis or tower, is an enclosure specifically designed to house and protect the various components of a computer system. It is a physical structure that contains the motherboard, CPU, power supply, storage devices, expansion cards, and other peripherals.<br><br>
                                Computer cases come in various sizes and form factors, ranging from compact mini-ITX cases to larger full-tower cases. They also come in a variety of styles and aesthetics to cater to different user preferences, offering features like windowed side panels, RGB lighting, and customizable designs.<br><br>
                                It provides several important functions like Protection, Organization, Cooling, Connectivity, Expansion and Upgradability</p>

                                <p>Computer cases rely on computer fans inside them to create proper airflow to keep all the internals cool and working reliably.
                                    A computer case, like most things, varies in quality. You can get them made from cheap metals or good quality materials that provide you with a sturdy design.<br><br>A good motherboard offers a wide amount of connectivity options. It also has the least amount of bottlenecks possible.<br><br>
                                    This allows all the components to operate efficiently and to fulfill their maximum potential as they were designed to do.<br><br>
                                    Obviously, as the physical size is reduced, it begins to limit connectivity options and functionality.</p>

                                    <h2 align =center><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b></h2>
                                    <center><img src="https://gov-civil-braga.pt/img/pc-hardware/55/computer-processor-it-s-uses-central-processing-unit.jpg" width="30%"/></center>
                                    <p>The CPU or central processing unit is basically like the brain of computer systems. It processes all the information on a computational level.
                                        It takes all the processes from the RAM and processes them to perform the tasks required by the computer system.<br><br>BGA (Ball Grid Array): The CPU is soldered directly onto the motherboard. This makes it a non- user-swappable component. It is susceptible to bad connectivity.<br><br>Here are some common examples:
                                        • ZIF (Zero Insertion Force): Although this is a more desirable socket, they are mostly found on older computer motherboards. A lever-operated mechanism to clamp the pins of the processor.<br><br>
                                        • PGA (Pin Grid Array): It is also a ZIF socket but has a different pin pitch and contains a different pin count.<br><br>
                                        • LGA (Land Grid Array): More commonly found on motherboards today. A levered hinged plate with a center cut-out clamps down on the processor.<br><br>The central processing unit is usually seated in a socket that utilizes a lever or a latch with a hinged plate with a cut-out in the center to secure the CPU onto the motherboard.
                                        It has many copper pads underneath it for the socket contacts to push up against them to make electrical contact.
                                        There are other ways CPUs can be attached to the motherboard.<br><br>A processor generates a decent amount of heat, especially when it is working under high loads.
                                        It will run even hotter when it is set to a higher clock speed to make it run faster. This is called overclocking.
                                        This is why a heatsink and fan assembly are required to draw the heat away from the central processing unit and distribute it to thin sheets or fins of metal for the fan to cool down.<br><br>There are so many different types of computer processors. The top manufacturers of processors are Intel,
                                        AMD, and NVidia.</p>

                                        <h2 align =center><b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b></h2>
                                    <center><img src="http://www.defit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ram-320x186.jpg" width="30%"/></center>
                                    <p>Certain RAM modules are sold with a heat spreader. It helps dissipate the heat from the individual memory ICs, keeping them cooler.<br><br>RAM is a data storage device that can provide fast read and write access. RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses all the stored data when power is lost.<br><br>
                                        The RAM keeps data ready for the CPU to process. The RAM speed is a big contributor to the overall speed of a computer system.
                                        It plugs directly into a long slot that has contacts on either side of the slot.<br><br>
                                        It, too, has a clock speed, just like a processor. So, it can also be overclocked to deliver increased performance beyond the intended specification.<br><br>RAM has evolved like any other component. RAM used on the motherboard often uses DDR (Double Data Rate) SDRAM (Synchronous

                                        RAM Amount always comes in powers of 2, so you will always see numbers like 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of RAM, to mention some examples of memory units.</p>

                                <p>A video card plugs into a PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) slot on the motherboard. It is a serial expansion bus slot capable of high bandwidth in two directions.<br><br>
                                    A graphics card has a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), the main part of a computer system that requires cooling.<br><br>
                                    A GPU is slower than a CPU but is designed to deal with mathematical operations required for video rendering.<br><br>
                                    The card's memory amount varies depending on the manufacturer's design because of the large processing requirements for a gaming GPU, fans
                                    are almost a given.<br><br>A graphics card is an output device that processes the data from the motherboard and sends the appropriate information to the computer's screen for display.<br><br>
                                    You can connect monitors to it using HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, or VGA connectors, it can also be referred to as a video or display card.<br><br>
                                    A video card takes the burden of all the video processing from the main CPU. This gives a computer a big boost in performance.The card's memory amount varies depending on the manufacturer's design.<br><br>
                                    Video cards use GDDR (Graphics Double Data Rate) SDRAM, which is specially designed to optimize graphics performance.</p>

                                <p>Sound cards plug into a computer in
                                    multiple ways. It can be through USB, PCI slot, or PCI Express x 1 slot.
                                    External DACs have gained much more popularity and help deliver clearer and more defined audio or high-definition sound output.<br><br>
                                    They connect up using an IO cable like a USB cable to your computer or laptop and provide a line out for your speakers or headphones.<br><br>
                                    A sound processing chip on the card does all of the audio processing and is usually not a very powerful processor.</p>

                                <p>A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a type of computer storage device that is used to store and retrieve digital information. It consists of one or more rotating disks, also known as platters, which are coated with a magnetic material that allows data to be stored and retrieved using read/write heads.<br><br>

                                    The function of an HDD is to provide a long-term storage solution for digital data. When data is written to an HDD, it is stored on the magnetic platters in the form of magnetic fields. When the data needs to be accessed, the read/write heads move over the surface of the disks and read the magnetic fields to retrieve the data.<br><br></p>

                                <p>An SSD is also a type of hard drive, but it doesn't have any moving bits. It consists of a bank of flash memory that can hold a reasonable amount of information.<br><br>While SSDs are increasing in size all the time, they aren't cost-effective for storing large amounts.<br><br>
                                    A mechanical drive has a cheaper gigabyte-to-dollar ratio.<br><br>
                                    However, the SSD is a high-performance drive. It's fast and cannot be as easily damaged by dropping it or taking a few bumps.<br><br>
                                    SSDs are available as 2.5-inch laptop encapsulated drives, and an M.2 SDD is the most commonly used kind on the market.<br><br>That's why I always recommend SSDs for portable-type computers where possible. In our other article, you can read more about whether or not SSD's

                                <p>A power supply unit mounts inside the computer case. It converts the AC mains supply from the power cord from a wall socket and supplies the correct DC voltages to all the components inside the computer.<br><br>
                                    A computer power supply supplies the following voltages:<br><br>• +3.3v: This voltage is supplied to the motherboard.<br><br>
                                    • +5V: This voltage is supplied to the motherboard and other computer hardware.<br><br>

                                <p>A scanner can take anything on paper, and it functions by scanning it to produce a replicated digital image for a computer to save.<br><br>
                                    This is also handy for saving physical photos you want to preserve.
                                    Once the photo is stored digitally, it won't decay as a physical photo does over time.<br><br>
                                    The flatbed scanner is the most commonly used today.</p>

                                <p>A printer can take an image sent by a computer and deliver it onto a sheet of paper.<br><br>
                                    It does this by using the information from the computer, and by either using toner or ink, it deposits one of these in a controlled and accurate manner to form the image.<br><br>Many all-in-one devices, also known as multifunction devices, have printer and scanning capabilities in one reasonably compact product.</p>

                                <p>Computer speakers can connect to the sound card at the rear of the computer.
                                    Another way they can be connected is by a monitor that already has built-in speakers.<br><br>
                                    Generally, the sound quality is poor from a monitor's speakers. That's why most people buy a set of computer speakers for their desks.
                                    You can even connect up a 7.1 surround speaker system to certain sound cards for a computer.</p>

                                Conclusion
That covers all the components of a computer system. All of these play a vital function in a computer to make it work.<br><br>
Once you understand these basic parts to a memorable level, it probably won't be long until you repair or build desktops yourself.
